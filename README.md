# Title: Bad Bank Website

_Created by Maegan Stayrook_

Description:
A portfolio project to create a website to display functionality, web design, React components, validation, and more.

How to Run:
- Navigate the navbar through the pages.
- Create an account; type at least 3 letters for the name, a full email, and at least 8 characters for the password.
- withdraw money; negative numbers and letters will not work. Letters will not work. You will not be able to withdraw over the account balance.
- deposit money; negative numbers and letters will not work. Letters will not work. 
- view JSON data in a nice, easy-to-read format on the User Data page.
- Refresh page to reload and start over.

Roadmap:
- Implement an "About this Site" page that is accessible from the navigation bar. For some reason, React Router is not registering the current links as a viable route.
- Implement more validation on create account page.
- Create a login page.
- Spruce up the home page some more.
- overall better CSS and design.
